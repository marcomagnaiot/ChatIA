# Product Context: AI Conversation Orchestrator

## 1. Problem Statement

Users and developers interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) often work with multiple AI services (like Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) independently. There isn't a straightforward way to:

-   Directly compare their responses to the same evolving context in a dynamic, conversational manner.
-   Observe how different AIs might build upon, contradict, or complement each other's outputs in a continuous dialogue.
-   Experiment with chained AI interactions where the output of one model becomes the input for another, potentially leading to novel or complex generated content.
-   Manage API keys (via a config file) and interaction settings (via config file or command-line prompts) for multiple AIs in a single script.

## 2. Solution: AI Conversation Orchestrator

The AI Conversation Orchestrator will be a Python script that allows users to:

-   Store their API keys in a local configuration file.
-   Define participating AIs, an initial prompt, and the first AI recipient (via config file or command-line prompts).
-   Observe (in the console) as the selected AIs take turns responding, with each AI's output potentially influencing the next AI's input.
-   Have the entire conversation automatically appended to a local log file.

## 3. Target Users

-   **AI Researchers & Enthusiasts:** Individuals curious about the comparative behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses of different LLMs.
-   **Content Creators & Writers:** People looking for novel ways to generate ideas, drafts, or creative text by leveraging multiple AI perspectives.
-   **Developers & Prompt Engineers:** Professionals experimenting with prompt chaining and multi-agent systems to achieve complex tasks or explore AI capabilities.

## 4. User Experience Goals

-   **Simplicity:** Easy to configure (via text file) and run (via command line).
-   **Clarity:** The flow of conversation and attribution of responses to specific AIs should be clear in the console output and log file.
-   **Control:** Users define participating AIs, initial message, and first AI recipient.
-   **Insight:** The script facilitates learning and discovery about multi-AI interactions.
-   **Security (Local):** API keys are stored in a local configuration file, read by the script, and used for API calls.

## 5. Value Proposition

-   **Unique Experimentation:** Offers a unique platform to stage and observe direct, chained conversations between different leading AI models.
-   **Comparative Insight:** Provides a practical way to see how different AIs interpret and respond to the same conversational thread.
-   **Creative Exploration:** Unlocks potential for generating more diverse, nuanced, or unexpected content than a single AI might produce.
-   **Educational Tool:** Serves as an educational resource for understanding the characteristics of various LLMs.
