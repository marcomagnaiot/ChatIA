# AI Orchestrator

A Python application that orchestrates conversations between multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) in a round-robin fashion. The AIs engage in structured dialogues, building upon each other's responses to explore complex topics and generate rich, multi-perspective conversations.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-AI Conversations**: Supports ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Claude (Anthropic)
- **Round-Robin Dialogue**: AIs take turns responding to each other in a configurable order
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customize conversation parameters, AI participants, and model selection
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Dual logging system with detailed timestamps and clean dialogue-only logs
- **Model Selection**: Choose from the latest AI models with different capabilities and pricing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Security-First**: Template-based configuration to protect API keys

## üöÄ Quick Start

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversation_log.txt    # Detailed log with timestamps
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conversation_alone.txt  # Clean dialogue-only log
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses `config.ini` for all settings. Here are the key configuration options:

### API Keys
```ini
[API_KEYS]
CHATGPT_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY  = your-google-api-key-here
CLAUDE_API_KEY  = your-anthropic-api-key-here
```

### Conversation Settings
```ini
[CONVERSATION_SETTINGS]
# Which AIs participate and in what order
PARTICIPATING_AIS = ChatGPT,Claude

# The message that starts the conversation
INITIAL_MESSAGE = Hello! Let's discuss artificial intelligence.

# Which AI receives the first message
INITIAL_AI_TARGET = ChatGPT

# Number of back-and-forth exchanges after the initial response
NUMBER_OF_TURNS = 10

# How many previous messages each AI sees for context
HISTORY_LENGTH = 5

# Where to save the conversation log
LOG_FILE = conversation_log.txt

# Optional instructions sent to all AIs
SYSTEM_PROMPT = You are a helpful assistant.
```

### Model Selection
```ini
# Choose specific models for each AI service
CHATGPT_MODEL_NAME = gpt-4.1-mini    # Cost-effective option
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME = gemini-2.0-flash  # Fast and efficient
CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME = claude-sonnet-4   # Balanced performance
```

## ü§ñ Supported AI Models

### OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **gpt-4o** - Latest GPT-4 optimized model (high capability, higher cost)
- **gpt-4.1-mini** - Compact version with good performance (recommended for cost-effectiveness)
- **gpt-4.1** - Enhanced GPT-4 with improvements
- **o3** - Advanced reasoning model (specialized use cases)

### Google (Gemini)
- **gemini-2.5-pro-preview** - Latest Pro model (best quality)
- **gemini-2.0-flash** - Current Flash model (recommended for speed)
- **gemini-1.5-pro-latest** - Stable Pro version
- **gemini-1.5-flash-latest** - Stable Flash version

### Anthropic (Claude)
- **claude-opus-4** - Most capable model (highest quality, higher cost)
- **claude-sonnet-4** - Balanced performance and cost (recommended)

## üí° Usage Examples

### Philosophy Debate
```ini
PARTICIPATING_AIS = ChatGPT,Claude
INITIAL_MESSAGE = We are two philosophers debating the nature of consciousness. One argues for materialism, the other for dualism. Begin the debate.
NUMBER_OF_TURNS = 20
SYSTEM_PROMPT = You are a knowledgeable philosopher. Present rigorous arguments and respond thoughtfully to counterarguments.
```

### Creative Writing
```ini
PARTICIPATING_AIS = ChatGPT,Gemini,Claude
INITIAL_MESSAGE = Let's collaboratively write a science fiction story. Start with a character discovering something unusual.
NUMBER_OF_TURNS = 15
SYSTEM_PROMPT = You are a creative writer. Build upon the previous narrative while adding your own creative elements.
```

INITIAL_MESSAGE = Discuss the pros and cons of different machine learning architectures for natural language processing.
SYSTEM_PROMPT = You are a technical expert. Provide detailed, accurate information and cite relevant research when possible.
```

## üìä Cost Management

AI API calls cost money based on token usage. Here are some tips to manage costs:

### Cost-Effective Settings
- Use smaller models: `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `claude-haiku-3.5`
- Reduce `NUMBER_OF_TURNS` for shorter conversations
- Lower `HISTORY_LENGTH` to reduce context size
- Test with 2-3 turns before running long conversations

### Monitoring Usage
- Check your API usage dashboards regularly
- Set up billing alerts in your AI service accounts
- Monitor the generated log files to understand token consumption patterns

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not find configuration file"**
- Ensure you've copied `config.template.ini` to `config.ini`
- Check that the file is in the same directory as `ai_orchestrator.py`

**"API key appears to be placeholder"**
- Edit `config.ini` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the API key

**"AI not recognized"**
- Check spelling in `PARTICIPATING_AIS` (case-sensitive: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)
- Ensure the AI name matches exactly

**API Errors**
- Verify your API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
- Check that the model names are correct and currently available
- Some models may have usage restrictions or require special access

### Debug Mode
To debug issues, start with minimal settings:
```ini
PARTICIPATING_AIS = ChatGPT
NUMBER_OF_TURNS = 2
HISTORY_LENGTH = 2
INITIAL_MESSAGE = Hello, how are you?
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Never commit `config.ini`** with real API keys to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent accidental commits
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them periodically
- Monitor your API usage for unexpected activity
- Consider using environment variables for API keys in production deployments

## üìù Log Files

The application generates two types of logs:

### Detailed Log (`conversation_log.txt`)
Contains timestamps, system messages, and full conversation flow:
```
[2025-05-28 16:30:15] System: Starting conversation. Log file: conversation_log.txt
[2025-05-28 16:30:15] USER: Hello! Let's discuss AI.
[2025-05-28 16:30:18] ChatGPT: Hello! I'd be happy to discuss AI with you...
```

### Clean Dialogue Log (`conversation_alone.txt`)
Contains only the conversation without timestamps:
```
USER: Hello! Let's discuss AI.
ChatGPT: Hello! I'd be happy to discuss AI with you...
Claude: That's a fascinating topic. From my perspective...
```
